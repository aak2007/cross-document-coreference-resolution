/** 
 * The dataset is EECB 1.0, which is annotated by the Stanford NLP group on the basis of ECB corpus created by Bejan and Harabagiu (2010).
 * The difference between ECB and EECB is listed below:
 * (1) ECB just annotates the event, while EECB also annotates the entities involved in the event. For example
 * Saints put Bush on I.R. The event "put" has two arguments, the first is Arg0 Saints, and the second is Arg1 Bush.
 * The idea of the paper, Joint Entity and Event Coreference Resolution across Documents, is to model entity and event jointly in an iterative way.
 * 
 * 
 * So we need to read those EECB dataset in order to do the research
